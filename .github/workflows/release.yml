# This GitHub action can publish assets for release when a tag is created.
# Currently its setup to run on any tag that matches the pattern "v*" (ie. v0.1.0).
#
# This uses an action (crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg) that assumes you set your
# private key in the `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secret and passphrase in the `PASSPHRASE`
# secret. If you would rather own your own GPG handling, please fork this action
# or use an alternative one for key handling.
