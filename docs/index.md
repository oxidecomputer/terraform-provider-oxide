# Oxide Provider

The Oxide provider is used to declaratively manage
[Oxide](https://oxide.computer) infrastructure.

The provider uses the [Oxide Go SDK](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide.go)
to create, read, update, and delete Oxide resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Oxide provider.
provider "oxide" {}

resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  # ...
}
```

## Authentication

### Environment Variables

Export the `OXIDE_HOST` and `OXIDE_TOKEN` environment variables, or the
`OXIDE_PROFILE` environment variable. This is the recommended authentication
method.

```terraform
provider "oxide" {}
```

### Profile

Use a profile from the credentials file created via `oxide auth login`. This
can be set using the `OXIDE_PROFILE` environment variable or the `profile`
argument in the provider configuration.

```terraform
provider "oxide" {
  profile = "example"
}
```

### Host & Token

Set the host and token within the configuration. Use variables to keep sensitive
credentials out of the configuration.

```terraform
variable "oxide_token" {
  type        = string
  description = "Oxide API token."
  sensitive   = true
}

provider "oxide" {
  host  = "https://oxide.sys.example.com"
  token = "oxide-token-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `host` (String) Oxide API host (e.g., https://oxide.sys.example.com). Conflicts with `profile`.
- `profile` (String) Profile to load from the Oxide credentials file. Conflicts with `host` and `token`.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Oxide API token. Conflicts with `profile`.
