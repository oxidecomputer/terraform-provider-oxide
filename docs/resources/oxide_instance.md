# oxide_instance (Resource)

This resource manages instances.

-> Updates will stop and reboot the instance.

-> When setting a boot disk, the boot disk ID should also be included as part of `disk_attachments`.

## Example Usage

### Basic instance with attached disks and a network interface

```hcl
resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  project_id       = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  boot_disk_id     = "611bb17d-6883-45be-b3aa-8a186fdeafe8"
  description      = "a test instance"
  name             = "myinstance"
  host_name        = "<host value>"
  memory           = 1073741824
  ncpus            = 1
  ssh_public_keys  = ["066cab1b-c550-4aea-8a80-8422fd3bfc40", "1aa748cb-26f0-4bf5-8faf-b202dc74d698"]
  disk_attachments = ["611bb17d-6883-45be-b3aa-8a186fdeafe8", "eb65d5cb-d8c5-4eae-bcf3-a0e89a633042"]
  network_interfaces = [
    {
      subnet_id   = "066cab1b-c550-4aea-8a80-8422fd3bfc40"
      vpc_id      = "9b9f9be1-96bf-44ad-864a-0dedae3b3999"
      description = "a sample nic"
      name        = "mynic"
    },
  ]
  timeouts = {
    read   = "1m"
    create = "3m"
    delete = "2m"
  }
}
```

### Assign an IP pool for the instance and do not start instance on creation

```hcl
resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  project_id      = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description     = "a test instance"
  name            = "myinstance"
  host_name       = "<host value>"
  memory          = 1073741824
  ncpus           = 1
  start_on_create = false
  external_ips = [
    {
      type = "ephemeral"
    },
    {
      id   = "eb65d5cb-d8c5-4eae-bcf3-a0e89a633042"
      type = "floating"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Define user data

```hcl
resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  project_id  = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description = "a test instance"
  name        = "myinstance"
  host_name   = "<host value>"
  memory      = 1073741824
  ncpus       = 1
  user_data   = filebase64("path/to/init.sh")
}
```
