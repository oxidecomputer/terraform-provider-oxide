# oxide_instance (Resource)

This resource manages instances.

!> Instances must be stopped before updating disk attachments and deleting

## Example Usage

### Basic instance with attached disks

```hcl
resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  project_id       = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description      = "a test instance"
  name             = "myinstance"
  host_name        = "<host value>"
  memory           = 1073741824
  ncpus            = 1
  disk_attachments = ["611bb17d-6883-45be-b3aa-8a186fdeafe8", "1aa748cb-26f0-4bf5-8faf-b202dc74d698"]
  timeouts = {
    read   = "1m"
    create = "3m"
    delete = "2m"
  }
}
```

### Assign an IP pool for the instance and do not start instance on creation

```hcl
resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  project_id      = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description     = "a test instance"
  name            = "myinstance"
  host_name       = "<host value>"
  memory          = 1073741824
  ncpus           = 1
  start_on_create = false
  external_ips    = ["myippool"]
}
```

### Define user data

```hcl
resource "oxide_instance" "example" {
  project_id  = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description = "a test instance"
  name        = "myinstance"
  host_name   = "<host value>"
  memory      = 1073741824
  ncpus       = 1
  user_data   = filebase64("path/to/init.sh")
}
```
