# oxide_disk (Resource)

This resource manages disks.

To create a blank disk it's necessary to set `block_size`. Otherwise, one of `source_image_id` or `source_snapshot_id` must be set; `block_size` will be automatically calculated.

!> Disks cannot be deleted while attached to instances. Please detach or delete associated instances before attempting to delete.

-> This resource currently only provides create, read and delete actions. An update requires a resource replacement

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "oxide_disk" "example" {
  project_id  = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description = "a test disk"
  name        = "mydisk"
  size        = 1073741824
  block_size  = 512
}

resource "oxide_disk" "example2" {
  project_id      = "c1dee930-a8e4-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"
  description     = "a test disk"
  name            = "mydisk2"
  size            = 1073741824
  source_image_id = "49118786-ca55-49b1-ae9a-e03f7ce41d8c"
  timeouts = {
    read   = "1m"
    create = "3m"
    delete = "2m"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Description for the disk.
- `name` (String) Name of the disk.
- `project_id` (String) ID of the project that will contain the disk.
- `size` (Number) Size of the disk in bytes.

### Optional

- `block_size` (Number) Size of blocks in bytes.
- `source_image_id` (String) Image ID of the disk source if applicable.
- `source_snapshot_id` (String) Snapshot ID of the disk source if applicable.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `device_path` (String) Path of the disk.
- `id` (String) Unique, immutable, system-controlled identifier of the disk.
- `time_created` (String) Timestamp of when this disk was created.
- `time_modified` (String) Timestamp of when this disk was last modified.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import oxide_disk.example 3e2c6e84-bed8-4c94-afc3-1032082d6a90
```
