# oxide_silo (Resource)

This resource manages the creation of an Oxide silo.

-> Only the `quotas` attribute supports in-place modification. Changes to other
attributes will result in the silo being destroyed and created anew.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "oxide_silo" "example" {
  name             = "showcase"
  description      = "Demo and event silo."
  admin_group_name = "showcase_admin"
  identity_mode    = "saml_jit"
  discoverable     = true
  mapped_fleet_roles = {
    admin  = ["admin", "collaborator"]
    viewer = ["viewer"]
  }
  quotas = {
    cpus    = 64
    memory  = 137438953472 # 128 GiB
    storage = 549755813888 # 512 GiB
  }
  tls_certificates = [
    {
      name        = "wildcard_cert"
      description = "Wildcard cert for *.sys.oxide.example.com."
      cert        = file("cert.pem")
      key         = file("key.pem")
      service     = "external_api"
    },
  ]
}
```

- `discoverable` (Boolean) Whether this silo is discoverable and present in the silo list.
- `name` (String) Unique, immutable, user-controlled identifier of the silo.
- `quotas` (Attributes) Limits the amount of provisionable CPU, memory, and storage in the silo. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--quotas))
- `tls_certificates` (Attributes List, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Initial TLS certificates to be used for the new silo's console and API endpoints. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tls_certificates))

### Optional

- `admin_group_name` (String) If set, this group will be created during silo creation and granted the `Silo Admin` role.
- `identity_mode` (String) How users and groups are managed in the silo.
- `mapped_fleet_roles` (Map of List of String) Mapped fleet roles for the silo.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique, immutable, system-controlled identifier of the silo.
- `time_created` (String) Timestamp of when this silo was created.
- `time_modified` (String) Timestamp of when this silo was last modified.

### Nested Schema for `quotas`

Required:

- `cpus` (Number) Amount of virtual CPUs available for running instances in the silo.
- `memory` (Number) Amount of memory, in bytes, available for running instances in the silo.
- `storage` (Number) Amount of storage, in bytes, available for disks or snapshots.


<a id="nestedatt--tls_certificates"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tls_certificates`

Required:

- `cert` (String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) PEM-formatted string containing public certificate chain.
- `description` (String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Human-readable free-form text about the certificate.
- `key` (String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) PEM-formatted string containing private key.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
