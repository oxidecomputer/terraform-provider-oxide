# oxide_floating_ip (Resource)

This resource manages Oxide floating IPs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Allocate a floating IP from the silo's default IP pool
resource "oxide_floating_ip" "example" {
  project_id  = "5476ccc9-464d-4dc4-bfc0-5154de1c986f"
  name        = "app-ingress"
  description = "Ingress for application."
}

# Allocate a floating IP from the specified IP pool 
resource "oxide_floating_ip" "example_with_pool" {
  project_id  = "5476ccc9-464d-4dc4-bfc0-5154de1c986f"
  name        = "app-ingress"
  description = "Ingress for application."
  ip_pool_id  = "a4720b36-006b-49fc-a029-583528f18a4d"
}

# Allocate a specific floating IP from the specified IP pool
resource "oxide_floating_ip" "example_with_address" {
  project_id  = "5476ccc9-464d-4dc4-bfc0-5154de1c986f"
  name        = "app-ingress"
  description = "Ingress for application."
  ip_pool_id  = "a4720b36-006b-49fc-a029-583528f18a4d"
  ip          = "172.21.252.128"

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Human-readable free-form text about the floating IP.
- `name` (String) Unique, mutable, user-controlled identifier for the floating IP.
- `project_id` (String) Project ID where this floating IP is located.

### Optional

- `ip` (String) IP address for this floating IP. If unset an IP address will be chosen from the given `ip_pool_id`.
- `ip_pool_id` (String) IP pool ID to allocate this floating IP from. If unset the silo's default IP pool is used.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique, immutable, system-controlled identifier for the floating IP.
- `instance_id` (String) Instance ID that this floating IP is attached to, if presently attached.
- `time_created` (String) Timestamp when this floating IP was created.
- `time_modified` (String) Timestamp when this floating IP was last modified.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import oxide_floating_ip.example 3e2c6e84-bed8-4c94-afc3-1032082d6a90
```
