# oxide_external_subnet (Resource)

This resource manages external subnets allocated from subnet pools.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Human-readable free-form text about the external subnet.
- `name` (String) Unique, mutable, user-controlled identifier for the external subnet.
- `project_id` (String) Project ID where this external subnet is located.

### Optional

- `ip_version` (String) IP version to use when multiple default pools exist. Required if both IPv4 and IPv6 default subnet pools are configured for the silo. Possible values: `v4`, `v6`. Conflicts with `subnet`.
- `prefix_len` (Number) The prefix length for automatic subnet allocation (e.g., 24 for a /24). Conflicts with `subnet`. Required when using automatic allocation.
- `subnet` (String) The subnet CIDR to reserve. Must be available in the pool. Conflicts with `prefix_len`. If unset, a subnet will be automatically allocated with the specified `prefix_len`.
- `subnet_pool_id` (String) Subnet pool ID to allocate from. If unset when using automatic allocation (`prefix_len`), the silo's default subnet pool is used. Conflicts with `subnet`.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique, immutable, system-controlled identifier of the external subnet.
- `instance_id` (String) Instance ID this external subnet is attached to, if any.
- `subnet_pool_member_id` (String) The subnet pool member this subnet was allocated from.
- `time_created` (String) Timestamp when this external subnet was created.
- `time_modified` (String) Timestamp when this external subnet was last modified.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
