## Authentication

As a preferred method of authentication, export the `OXIDE_HOST` and `OXIDE_TOKEN` environment variables with their corresponding values.

There are two alternatives to this:

### Host and Token Arguments
It is possible to authenticate via the optional `host` and `token` arguments. In most cases this method of authentication is not recommended. It is generally preferable to keep credential information out of the configuration.

### Profile Argument
Another option is to use profile-based authentication by passing the `profile` argument. If you have authenticated using the Oxide CLI with `oxide auth login --host https://$YourSiloDnsName`, a `profile` will be created in your `credentials.toml`. You can reference this `profile` directly in your Terraform provider block.

Note: Cannot use `profile` with `host` and `token` arguments and vice versa.
